# ASEFinal_WahWah

## Motivation
This project is a VST compatible plugin emulating a Wah-Wah pedal, such as the classic Cry-Baby.
Unlike a traditional wah-wah effect which requires constant user input, this plugin automates the control over the wah-wah effect for greater ease of use.

## Applications
Our primary user base will be guitar players, but it should be useful for processing piano or any other instrument
